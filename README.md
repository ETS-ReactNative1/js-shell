# JS Shell

<p style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT! JS Shell is no longer being actively maintained and is replaced with the <a href="https://github.com/zenOSmosis/reshell">ReShell</a> project.</p>

**Note: This is currently prototype, and experimental code; it is not recommended for usage at all right now!**


General-purpose, multi-threaded, computing environment for web browsers and tablets, with STDIO bindings into a Node.js server over a Socket.io bridge.

It is like a virtual desktop into a Docker / Linux server, though the desktop is not streamed (only file / data I/O), and the execution context is pure JavaScript.

The Shell GUI frontend will have full local user privileges (and can be elevated) into the Docker / Linux server it is bound to.

## Multi-Device Testing

We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to test on a variety of devices and operating systems.

## Current Development State

Pre-initial prototype.

## Building / Running

**Important: Production builds are not currently implemented**

Build instructions are not avialable at this time, however it uses a Docker Compose configuration.

It can be preliminarily spun up by executing:

```bash
# Dependencies
#   - Docker
#   - Docker Compose

# (+) Development Dependencies
#   - Node 10

# ---------------
# If Production
$ ./build.prod.sh # Currently not available

# or...

# If Development
$ ./build.dev.sh
# ---------------

# Launch
$ ./run.sh
```

## System Design

The following represents a non-extensive design overview of the system architecture.

### Backend

#### Docker Compose

The entire backend environment can be run locally, for development by following the "Building / Running" section above.

#### Nginx (Reverse Proxy / SSL Termination Endpoint)

Nginx is the primary SSL termination endpoint and reverse proxy for https://github.com/zenOSmosis/docker-dev-ssl-proxy in the development environment.

zenOSmosis will be using https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-letsencrypt for production environments.

TODO: Determine if docker-letsencrypt STAGING set to true can replace using docker-dev-ssl-proxy for development, in order to reduce multiple configurations across environments.

#### Docker Modules

The {root}/docker_modules directory specifies additional Docker packages which help form the infrastructure of the Shell and its related services.

Note that some of the Docker modules are pulled directly from upstream and do not live in this directory.

- [dev-ssl-proxy](https://github.com/zenOSmosis/docker-dev-ssl-proxy): An Nginx server utilized as a reverse proxy and SSL termination point for the development environment.
- [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis): Utilized to manage multiple Socket.io connections across multiple Node.js processes.
- [docker-coturn](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenosmosis/docker-coturn): STUN / TURN servers for WebRTC.
- [Searx](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx): A free metasearch engine with the aim of protecting the privacy of its users. To this end, searx does not share users' IP addresses or search history with the search engines from which it gathers results.

#### Node.js Server

Currently developed with Node.js 10, run straight from source (not compiled).

- Source file compilation: None
- Module path resolution definitions: backend/package.json (_moduleAliases)
- Supports ES6+ import w/ Node.js 10 via https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm

### Frontend

Currently developed with Node.js 10, compiled with Webpack.

- Built on: [Facebook's Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Source file compilation: Webpack
- [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) config: frontend/config-overrides.js
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement) supported: Yes
- Module path resolution definitions: frontend/jsonconfig.json (compilerOptions.paths)

Path resolutions:

The following paths make up the various utilities and views which bootstrap the Shell Desktop (UI) environment and related services.

- "apps" (frontend/src/apps): Individual applications which run in the Shell Desktop environment.  Applications typically contain their own set of UI components, though they all use resources from the general "components" below.
- "components" (frontend/src/components): React UI components, most of which are reusable and outside of an application-specific context.
- "config" (frontend/src/config): Configuration for the Shell Desktop.  Any values which may be passed from the environment should be intercepted here and exposed accordingly.
- "core" (frontend/src/core): Core processes and utilties which initialize the Shell and its services.
- "icons" (frontend/src/icons): SVG icons which, when included in components, are compiled into the Shell's JavaScript.
- "process" (frontend/src/process): A set of classes which comprise a forkable virtual process system, with STDIO, and several process extentions which provide STDIO / controller access to native Web Workers, audio and video hardware, etc.
- "shared" (frontend/src/shared): Data structures and code which are shared between server and client.
- "state" (frontend/src/state): A set of classes which provide multi-channeled state management for the Shell Desktop environment.
- "utils" (frontend/src/utils): Utility methods and factory functions for controlling the Shell Desktop environment.  These utilities make simple, programmatic interfaces for controlling all facets of the Shell Desktop environment.

### Naming Conventions

Except where usage of 3rd party libraries is concerned, with their own naming conventions:

- Variable names in camelCase.
  - Class names begin with UpperCase character.
  - Class instances being with lowerCase character.
- Boolean variable / property names prefixed with "is," unless the words "has," "have," "are" (or other forms of plural designation) are utilized elsewhere in the name.
- American English spelling variations (e.g. "isSizable" instead of "isSizeable").

### Troubleshooting

## Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached
- Solution: echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
- Reference: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/11406 (note, Gatsby is not utilized in this project)


## Motto

To contribute, however slightly, to the commonwealth of all human innovation and experience.
